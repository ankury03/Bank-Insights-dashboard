# Bank Loan Insights
### 1.Bank Loan Insights: Interactive Lending Performance Dashboard
A dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze bank loan data—highlighting application trends, funding distribution, borrower profiles, interest rates, and loan quality across U.S. states.

### 2.Purpose
This interactive analytics solution offers a comprehensive view of bank loan performance across different borrower segments and time periods. Developed using Power BI and MS SQL Server, the dashboard empowers financial teams to monitor trends, assess loan risk, and make data-backed lending decisions.

### 3.🧰 Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for building interactive reports and rich visual analytics.

- 📂 Power Query – Used for data transformation, filtering, and combining tables before visualization.

- 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Enables calculated fields, KPIs, time intelligence (MoM, MTD), and dynamic visual logic.

- 📐 Data Modeling – Well-defined relationships across multiple tables (loan details, customer info, payment status).

- 🖼️ File Format – .pbix for the report file and .png for visual exports.

### 4.🌟 Features / Highlights
🏦 Business Problem
Banks and financial institutions often lack clear visibility into lending outcomes, regional trends, and borrower reliability. Without timely and detailed analytics, identifying high-risk loans and optimizing funding strategies is difficult.

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver a single, interactive reporting interface that helps analysts and stakeholders:

- Monitor loan application volumes, fund disbursement, and repayments.

- Segment loans based on credit grade, state, home ownership, purpose, and employment length.

- Assess loan quality (good vs. bad) with breakdowns by status and financial performance.
